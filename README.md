In this Project I used **_descriptive_** and **_inferencial_** statistics to analyze **Stroop effect** in Python. In psychology, the **Stroop effect** is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task, check the __[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect)__.

**Some terminologies used in the process of analysis:**
- Dependent variables
- Independent variables
- Congruency(word and ink color are same)
- Incongruency(word and ink color are different)
- Null Hypothesis(H0)
- Alternative Hypothesis(H1)
- P-value
- Confidence interval
- Sample size
- Population size
- Descriptive statistics

**Test Conducted**
- t-tese; t-test is because sample size(n)=24 < 30

** Python Libraries used**
- Pandas
- Numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy

** Data set used**
- stroopdata.csv

** Conclusion drawn**
- _Average of "Congruent" and "Incongruent" variables are significantly different._
